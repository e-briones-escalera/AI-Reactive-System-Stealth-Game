## Dev Diary: Behind the Build
First I would like to thank you for reading this diary, I wanted to structure it like a blog, so it is easier to understand all of my notes and thoughts about this game. 

## Why did I create this game?
It all started when I was having a brainstorming session at night thinking how could I level up my career. I've always had the role of Technical Sound Designer in the games I've worked before, but I ended up thinking: **How could I go further?**  
We all know about AI by now, and how it is growing insanely fast in all industries, so I wanted to adapt and join the AI trend to have extra skills that could help me become a better professional in the gaming industry. At first I was afraid since back then 
I barely knew how to move myself around Unreal Engine, but I knew Unity and have worked with it before, so I thought: How hard can it be if I already know Unity? **Spoiler Alert: A LOT.**

## AI Challenges
Let's start with the most interesting part, shall we? I knew that Unreal Engine 5 had an AI system, but did I know how to work with it? Of course not. I researched a lot about the UE5 Blueprint system, the new Enhanced Input System, how Behaviour Trees and Blackboards work. I built this game from scratch, so I learned anything you can imagine: Blend Spaces, level design, create textures using blueprints, landscape and foliage mode (that made my computer crashed everytime I opened this project), and still, the biggest challenge I faced was making the AI enemy work.
