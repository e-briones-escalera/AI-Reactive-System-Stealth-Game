## Dev Diary: Behind the Build
First I would like to thank you for reading this diary, I wanted to structure it like a blog, so it is easier to understand all of my notes and thoughts about this game. 

## Why did I create this game?
It all started when I was having a brainstorming session at night thinking how could I level up my career. I've always had the role of Technical Sound Designer in the games I've worked before, but I ended up thinking: **How could I go further?**  
We all know about AI by now, and how it is growing insanely fast in all industries, so I wanted to adapt and join the AI trend to have extra skills that could help me become a better professional in the gaming industry. At first I was afraid since back then 
I barely knew how to move myself around Unreal Engine, but I knew Unity and have worked with it before, so I thought: How hard can it be if I already know Unity? **Spoiler Alert: A LOT.**

## AI Challenges
Let's start with the most interesting part, shall we? I knew that Unreal Engine 5 had an AI system, but did I know how to work with it? Of course not. I researched a lot about the UE5 Blueprints system

## Resources
Here is a list of resources that helped me A LOT to figure this out and be able to create this project. I hope you find them useful! Please feel free to reach out if you have any question or just want to talk more about it.
